# Indoor and Outdoor Navigation Assistance System Project

## Introduction
The Indoor and Outdoor Navigation Assistance System is a project aimed at assisting users in navigating both indoor and outdoor environments using AI-based technologies. This system provides features such as object detection, speech recognition, and route generation to help users reach their destinations efficiently.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for fast and accurate detection of objects in the environment.
- **Currency Recognition:** Identifies Tunisian banknotes using a fine-tuned MobileNet model.
- **Distance Estimation:** Calculates the real-time distance to detected objects using the pinhole camera model.
- **Face Recognition:** Recognizes known individuals through integrated face recognition.
- **Speech Recognition:** Supports voice commands for hands-free navigation.
- **Route Generation:** Provides optimal routes for both indoor and outdoor navigation.
- **Multi-threaded Processing:** Ensures responsive and efficient performance.
