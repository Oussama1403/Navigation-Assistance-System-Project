# Indoor and Outdoor Navigation System Project Todo List

## Object Detection Model Training
- [x] Complete initial steps in object detection using yolo model.
- [ ] Collect more diverse data from the environment (e.g., trees, cars, pedestrians).
- [ ] Train the object detection model using the collected and labeled data.
- [ ] Label the collected data with appropriate annotations for training.
- [ ] Evaluate the trained model's performance on test datasets.
- [ ] Test the code thoroughly with various input scenarios and validate the accuracy and efficiency of object detection.

## Speech Recognition Integration
- [x] Research and select a suitable speech recognition library or API.
- [ ] Implement the NLP functionality to filter and extract destinations.
- [ ] Integrate the selected speech recognition solution into the navigation system.
- [ ] Test the speech recognition functionality in different environments and conditions.
- [ ] Implement error handling and feedback mechanisms for speech recognition failures.

## Navigation Instructions Generation
- [ ] Implement natural language generation techniques for generating audio-based navigation instructions based on Speech Recognition results.
- [ ] Test the navigation instructions generation system with simulated and real-world scenarios.
